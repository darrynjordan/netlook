# netlook
To run, the processor requires a reference signal, a dataset and a few other parameters. 
Some default configurations are available in the data.cpp file.
Please ensure that the file paths in the data.cpp file are correct.

run ./netlook -h for options.

The datasets are +500MB each and thus not saved in the git repo.
