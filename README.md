To run, the processor requires a reference signal, a dataset and a few other parameters. 
Some default configurations are available in the data.cpp file under 'source'.
Please ensure that the file paths in the data.cpp file are correct.

The configuration (along with other options) can be altered in the main.cpp file.

The datasets are +500MB each and thus not saved in the git repo.
